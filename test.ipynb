      "London is the capital and largest city of England and the United Kingdom, with a population of just under 9 million. It stands on the River Thames in southeast England and has been a major settlement for two millennia. The City of London, its ancient core and financial center, was founded by the Romans as Londinium and retains its medieval boundaries. The City of Westminster, to the west of the City of London, has hosted the national government and parliament for centuries. Since the 19th century, the name \"London\" also refers to the metropolis around this core, historically split among several counties, which since 1965 has largely comprised Greater London.\n",
      "\n",
      "London is a major global city and exerts a strong influence in various fields such as arts, entertainment, fashion, commerce, finance, education, health care, media, science, technology, tourism, transport, and communications. It has the largest urban economy in Europe and is one of the major financial centers in the world. London is home to prestigious academic institutions such as Imperial College London, the London School of Economics, and University College London. It is the most visited city in Europe and has a busy city airport system. The London Underground is the oldest rapid transit system in the world.\n",
      "\n",
      "The diverse cultures of London encompass over 300 languages. Greater London has a population of about 9 million, making it Europe's third-most populous city. The Greater London Built-up Area is the fourth-most populous in Europe. The London metropolitan area is a megacity with a population of about 14 million.\n",
      "\n",
      "London has several World Heritage Sites, including the Tower of London, Kew Gardens, the combined Palace of Westminster, and Greenwich. Other landmarks include Buckingham Palace, the London Eye, Piccadilly Circus, St Paul's Cathedral, Tower Bridge, and Trafalgar Square. The city is known for its museums, galleries, libraries, and cultural venues, including the British Museum, National Gallery, Tate Modern, and British Library. Important sporting events held in London include the FA Cup Final, Wimbledon Tennis Championships, and the London Marathon. In 2012, London became the first city to host three Summer Olympic Games.\n",
